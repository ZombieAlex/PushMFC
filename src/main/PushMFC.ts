PushMFC.js - Pushbullet notifications for MyFreeCams

@TODO List
    * Pre-query all the given models to get around the long standing bug
        where MFC doesn't send any information for models that are online
        but "idle" and not in any other video state like away free chat etc
        at the moment you log in.  They do send that detail for friends, but
        nobody else.  I think this is queryable through an FCTYPE.DETAILS
        message.
    * Support logging for all friends of a given account
    * Support specifying models my name:
        [index: string]: Events[]; //Models can be specified by name
    * Support dynamic filters like:
        dynamic: {
            [index: string]: {
                when: (model, before, after) => boolean;
                push: Events[];
            }
        }

        Where it would look like:

        dynamic: {
            rank: {
                when: (model, before, after) => after !== 0;
                push: [pm.Events.All]
            }
